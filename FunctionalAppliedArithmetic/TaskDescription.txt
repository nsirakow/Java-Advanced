On the first line you are given a list of numbers. On the next lines you are passed different commands that you need to apply to all numbers in the list:
"add" -> adds 1;
"multiply" -> multiplies by 2;
"subtract" -> subtracts 1;
"print" -> prints all numbers on a new line.
The input will end with an "end" command, after which you need to print the result.
