You have a task to create your custom stack. You are aware of the Stack structure.
There is a collection to store the elements and two functions- to push an element and to pop it.
Keep in mind that the first element which is popped is the last in the collection.
The push method adds an element to the top of the collection and the pop method returns the top element and removes it.
Write your custom implementation of Stack<Integer> and implement your custom iterator.
Your Stack class should implement the "Iterable<Integer>" interface and your Iterator Class should implement "Iterator<Integer>" interface.
Your Custom Iterator should follow the rules of the Abstract Data Type - Stack. Like we said, the first element is the element at the top and so on.
Iterators are used only for iterating through the collection, they should not remove or mutate the elements.

The input will come from the console as lines of commands. Commands will only be push and pop, followed by integers for the push command and no another input for the pop command.
Format:
· "Push {element, secondElement…}"
· "Pop"
When you receive "END", the input is over. Foreach the stack twice and print all elements. Each element should be on a new line.

Examples:

Input                 Output         |      Input                   Output              |        Input                      Output
                                     |                                                  |
Push 1, 2, 3, 4       2              |      Push 1, 2, 3, 4         1                   |        Push 1, 2, 3, 4            No elements
Pop                   1              |      Pop                     3                   |        Pop
Pop                   2              |      Push 1                  2                   |        Pop
END                   1              |      END                     1                   |        Pop
                                     |                              1                   |        Pop
                                     |                              3                   |        Pop
                                     |                              2                   |        END
                                     |                              1                   |
